MinimalBible
============

A Bible app for android designed to be more focused in both UI and feature set. If you want to keep
track of the ongoing progress, check out the blog [over here](http://minimalbible.github.io/)!

While checking out the project will be enough to get started for most of the development, if you
want to work on the JavaScript backing the actual viewer, please locate and run the
`setup_js_build.sh` script in /app/src/main/assets/.

If you are on Windows and wish to work on Javascript, you must install the Node Package Manager and
all dependencies listed in `package.json` found at /app/src/main/assets.
