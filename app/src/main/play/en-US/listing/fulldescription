There are a lot of Bible apps available for Android, but what sets MinimalBible apart is the focus on a simple application design, ease-of-use, and speedy execution leading to more time focusing on what you're using the app for - reading your Bible.
Designed from the ground-up to be sleek and efficient, MinimalBible is focused on making a great experience without worrying about a lot of advanced features.

MinimalBible uses your internet connection to retrieve Bibles, but you will be prompted before doing so. The app will not connect to the internet without your consent.

MinimalBible is also an open-source application! If you're interested in helping the development, check it out over here: https://github.com/MinimalBible/MinimalBible
